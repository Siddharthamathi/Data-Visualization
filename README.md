**Data Visualization Project**

This project will investigate if there is a strong correlation between the economic output of a country and the life expectancy of its citizens.

The goals are to prepare data, followed by analysis with plots, and seek to explain the findings from the study.

**Data sources**

GDP Source: World Bank national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files.

Life expectancy Data Source: World Health Organization

**Conclusions**

This project was able to make quite a few data visualizations with the data even though there were only 96 rows and 4 columns.

The project was also able to answer the following questions:

1. Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
   
      Yes with Zimbabwe having the greatest increase.
   
2. Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?

    GDP has also increased for all countries in our list, especially for China.
   
3. Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
   
      Yes, there is a positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy for countries in our list.
   
4. What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
   
      Average life expectancy was between mid to high 70s for the countries except for Zimbabwe which was 50.
   
5. What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
    
      The life expectancy had a left skew, or most of the observations were on the right side.
